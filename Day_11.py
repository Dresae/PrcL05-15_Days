"""Day 11 Introduction to Numpy for Numerical Computing
==========================


1. Given a list of numbers, create a NUmpy array and find the sum and products of its elements
2. Implement a program that generates a Numpy array and reshapes it into a shape of 3x3 matrix
3. Write a python program that uses NumPy to find the mean, median and standard deviation of a given dataset
4. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a NumPy array and sort it in ascending order
5. Given a list of lists, create a 2D NumPy array and find the sum of elements in each row and column
6. Implement a program that generates a NumPy array and finds the maximun and minimum value
7. Write a function that takes a Numpy array and returns a new array and with all elements squared
8. Given a NUmpy array, calculate the dot product with the array with itself
9. Create a program that uses Numpy to calculate the inverse of a 2X2 matrix
10. Implement a function that takes a Numpy array and returns the transpose of the array 
11. Create a Numpy array for a python list and perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
12. Generate a Numpy array with random numbers and calculate its mean, median and standard deviation
13. Create a Numpy array and reshape it into a different shape
